# The DAFB scanout runs on clk_vid (rtl/pll_video.v, 25.175 MHz). sys_top.sdc
# decouples every clock domain with set_clock_groups, but its core-PLL pattern
# matches only the MAIN pll, so a second PLL lands in NO group and every
# framework path touching CLK_VIDEO (ascal video-in, OSD, HDMI transfer) gets
# timed against unrelated domains — design-wide false violations. MacLC hit
# exactly this (MacLC.sdc:78) and the fix is the same as pll_hdmi/pll_audio.
#
# The deliberate clk_sys <-> clk_vid crossings this blesses are safe by
# construction: (a) dual-clock M10Ks (the VRAM read port in MacQuadra800.sv — no
# timed cross-port arc), (b) 2FF *_meta synchronizers (fb_base/stride/mode into
# the scanout, the video-domain reset, and the VBL toggle back into clk_sys),
# and (c) vid_stride into the VRAM address mapper, which BOTH ports have to
# agree on, so it stays a clk_sys signal read combinationally by the clk_vid
# port -- quasi-static, and a change means the guest is redrawing anyway.
