| recovery.s — setjmp/longjmp-style test recovery via VBR.
|
| install_vbr():
|   1. Read the current VBR (set by ROM at boot).
|   2. Copy all 256 entries to our own vbr_table.
|   3. Overwrite CPU exception vectors (2..15) and TRAP vectors
|      (32..47) with recovery_stub.
|   4. Leave Line A (vector 10) alone — _Write trap goes through it.
|      (Note: vector 10 being ROM-owned means a test that issues a raw
|      $A000 Line A trap can't be caught here — flag those hw_unsafe.)
|   5. Leave autovector interrupts (25..31) to the ROM — they are not
|      crashes, and the disk driver needs its completion IRQ to finish
|      the _Write that persists results.
|   5. MOVEC our table to VBR.
|
| invoke_test_with_recovery(entry):
|   D0 returns 0 on normal RTS, non-zero (= exception vector) if a
|   handler fired and longjmp'd us back. Caller treats non-zero as
|   "test crashed, capture what we have".

    | Autovector interrupts (vectors 25..31) are deliberately LEFT to
    | the ROM. They are not "crashes" — if a test lowers IPL and the
    | 60Hz tick (or a driver's completion IRQ) fires, the ROM handler
    | services it and RTEs back to the test, which continues normally.
    | Overriding them here used to hang the bench: the .Sony / SCSI
    | driver's synchronous _Write (used to persist /Results.jsonl) lowers
    | IPL internally to wait for its completion interrupt, and routing
    | that IRQ into recovery_core jumped to a stale resume PC, so the
    | write never returned. (iotest never installed these and writes
    | fine; that was the tell.)

    | Save the OS originals of vectors 32..63 first. On AmigaOS the
    | exec SuperState()/Supervisor() path itself goes through a TRAP
    | vector — stealing 32..47 wholesale hangs the next exec call
    | (found the hard way under FS-UAE; the Mac twin of this lesson is
    | vector 10 / Line A above). The platform I/O bracket restores
    | these originals around every OS call via restore_os_traps /
    | install_recovery_traps below.

| Common recovery: restore SP to where the bench was waiting, mask

|
| MMU builds (assembled with --defsym MMU_RECOVERY=1) FIRST force

| with the 68040 MMU enabled (TC.E=1), and everything recovery touches
| beyond the payload's own identity-mapped block (low-mem ScrnBase read,
| framebuffer DOT writes) would access-fault inside the handler — a
| double fault. The stubs, vbr_table, this code, and the test stack are
| all inside the payload's identity mapping, so executing the disable
| itself is safe. On the 68040 the MMU is disabled via MOVEC (TC=0), not
| the 68030's PMOVE: MOVEC D0,TC = $4E7B $0003 (D0 zeroed first). D0 is
